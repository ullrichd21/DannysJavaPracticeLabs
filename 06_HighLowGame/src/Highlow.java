		Danny's Mini-Labs - 06
Goal:
  The goal of this lab is to take make a program that plays the
  classic "High Low" game. The computer will think of a random number
  and the user will try to guess that number. When the user guesses a
  number lower than the computer's the computer will say "Too Low!" and
  will say "Too High!" if the number is greater than the computer's
  number.

Example Output:
  Welcome to the High Low Game!
  I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100!
  50
  Too Low!
  80
  Too High!
  65
  Too Low!
  75
  Too High!
  70
  Too Low!
  72
  Too Low!
  73
  You got it! My number was 73!
  Would you like to play again?
  no
  Thanks for using my program!

Other Considerations:
  Can you make a basic AI that will guess the user's secret number?
  Maybe include an option to set the range the computer will use to generate
  a random number!

Important Instructions:
  You can compile your code using the bash file located in the
  parent directory of this lab. You can run the bash file by
  typing:
	./build.sh
  Then to run this lab you can execute the "run" bash file from
  the same directory by typing:
	./run.sh Highlow
