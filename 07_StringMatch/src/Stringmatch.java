		Danny's Mini-Labs - 07
Goal:
  The goal of this lab is to take make a program that compares
  two strings and points out whether they're a match, if not
  points out where they differ

Example Output:
  Welcome to the String Matcher program!
  String 1: This is example 1!
  String 2: This of exemple 2?
    These strings are different!

  "This is example 1!"
  "This of exemple 2?"
        ^^   ^     ^^
        The arrows point to where
        this string differs from
        the first!
  Thanks for using my program!

Important Instructions:
  You can compile your code using the bash file located in the
  parent directory of this lab. You can run the bash file by
  typing:
	./build.sh
  Then to run this lab you can execute the "run" bash file from
  the same directory by typing:
	./run.sh Stringmatch
