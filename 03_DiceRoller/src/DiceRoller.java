		Danny's Mini-Labs - 03
Goal:
  The goal of this lab is to take a string input from the user
  in the terminal then output a random number based on the dice
  size the user gave.

Example Output:
  Welcome to the Dice Roller Program!
  Dice to roll: d100
  	Rolling a d100 dice!
	I rolled a 78!
  Thanks for using Dice Roller!

Some things to consider:
  What classes do you need to import?
  Maybe ask if they want to roll again?
  Maybe ask if they want to roll more than one dice at the same time!
  Basic math operators like (d6 + d8) and return the sum of the two dice?

Important Instructions:
  You can compile your code using the bash file located in the 
  parent directory of this lab. You can run the bash file by
  typing:
	./build.sh
  Then to run this lab you can execute the "run" bash file from
  the same directory by typing:
	./run.sh DiceRoller
