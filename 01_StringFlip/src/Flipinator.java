		Danny's Mini-Labs - 01
Goal:
  The goal of this lab is to take a string input from the user
  in the terminal then output the string backwards.

Example Output:
  Welcome to the Text Flipinator Program!
  Text I should flip: Example input from User!
  Flipped: !resU morf tupni elpmaxE
  Thanks for using the Text Flipinator!

Some things to consider:
  What classes do you need to import?
  Loops?
  Consider writing a method to do this in one line!

Important Instructions:
  You can compile your code using the bash file located in the 
  parent directory of this lab. You can run the bash file by
  typing:
	./build.sh
  Then to run this lab you can execute the "run" bash file from
  the same directory by typing:
	./run.sh Flipinator
